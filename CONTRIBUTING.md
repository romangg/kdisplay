## Submission Guideline
Contributions to KDisplay are very welcome but follow a strict process that is layed out in detail
in Wrapland's [contributing document][wrapland-submissions].

*Summarizing the main points:*

* Use [merge requests][merge-request] directly for smaller contributions, but create
  [issue tickets][issue] *beforehand* for [larger changes][wrapland-large-changes].
* Adhere to the [KDE Frameworks Coding Style][frameworks-style].
* Merge requests have to be posted against master or a feature branch. Commits to the stable branch
  are only cherry-picked from the master branch after some testing on the master branch.

## Commit Message Guideline
The [Conventional Commits 1.0.0][conventional-commits] specification is applied with the following
amendments:

* Only the following types are allowed:
  * build: changes to the CMake build system, dependencies or other build-related tooling
  * ci: changes to CI configuration files and scripts
  * docs: documentation only changes to overall project or code
  * feat: new feature
  * fix: bug fix
  * perf: performance improvement
  * refactor: rewrite of code logic that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  * style: improvements to code style without logic change
  * test: addition of a new test or correction of an existing one
* Only the following optional scopes are allowed:
  * kcm
  * kded
  * plasmoid
* Angular's [Revert][angular-revert] and [Subject][angular-subject] policies are applied.

### Example

    fix(kcm): provide correct return value

    For function exampleFunction the return value was incorrect.
